- The producer-queue prerequisite is complete; paid traffic remains gated through LIFE-1.6 and LIFE-1.7 production certification.

# 408-LIFE-1.4.1 — Cloudflare Secure Submission Alignment

- Removed the LIFE-1.4 Netlify runtime/configuration and aligned the secure application-start boundary to the existing Cloudflare Pages deployment.

- Added phase-aware progress, local validation, accessible error states, mobile layouts, a deliberate quick-questions → application-details transition, and a no-JavaScript safeguard that leaves application fields disabled.
- Keeps all application data in native DOM memory only; no FormData serialization, localStorage/sessionStorage, URL encoding, Formspree, CoverageFit handoff, analytics payload, fetch/XHR, or producer notification is enabled.
- Treats `ssn_last4` as a dedicated sensitive field: it is masked, accepts exactly four digits, is excluded from all network/persistent paths, and all application-detail fields are cleared on completion, pagehide, and bfcache restoration.
- Preserved the direct Dylan fallback and the paid-traffic gate until LIFE-1.4 implements and certifies secure submission.
- Certified LIFE-1.3 at 45/45 dedicated checks, 265/265 static checks, 273/273 local links, 14/14 logo checks, and 34 passing local historical Node tests with 7 external receiver prerequisites blocked and 0 unexpected failures.

- Preserved CoverageFit v3.20.51 handoff compatibility, attribution, zero-repeat behavior, Buyer partner context, and RC-SMS through 1.9. Live SMS certification remains deferred.

## 408-CRO-1.1 — Entry Integrity and Trust

- Public runtime advances to `408-CRO-1.1`.
- Fixed the direct Buyer page so its hidden referral acknowledgement cannot render as an empty **Referred by** pill; partner-referred traffic continues to show its bounded partner name.
- Removed the stale `/home/Wowindex.html` sender and permanently redirects that URL to canonical `/home/`.
- Updated current paired-receiver metadata to CoverageFit v3.20.51 while retaining v3.20.13 as the audited minimum compatible receiver.

- Added bounded CRO-1.1 QA without changing prospect-profile, launch, attribution, assessment, or CoverageFit code.

## 408-PC-1.1 — End-to-End Consultation Workflow Certification

- Public runtime remains `408-BUY-1.5`; the FLOW-1.4 handoff already supplies all context required by CoverageFit v3.20.47.
- Replaced stale NP-1.4 and NP-1.5 cross-project version allowlists with minimum compatible receiver checks while retaining the actual referral, campaign, attribution, API, and migration contract assertions.
- No acquisition page, prospect profile, launch route, attribution field, assessment destination, or SMS behavior changed.

- Auto Bundle sends current housing through `housing_context` and `Home and auto together` as the actual review reason.
- The launcher sends `review_context`, `occupation_segment`, and `housing_context`; legacy `segment` remains receiver-compatible only.

## 408-FLOW-1.2 — Direct-Start Routing

- Public runtime advances to `408-BUY-1.4`.
- Explicit `Start My Coverage Review` actions on the 408FARMERS homepage and Home Protection Score now preserve the existing CoverageFit transition but continue directly to `/assessment/`, eliminating the redundant second Start click on CoverageFit Home.
- The shared launcher now honors declarative `data-cf-next` on ordinary CoverageFit launch elements, so future direct-start surfaces can use the same centralized routing contract rather than page-specific navigation.
- Softer/exploratory routes remain unchanged and may still land on CoverageFit Home. Existing form handoffs, buyer flows, attribution, zero-repeat behavior, and RC-SMS synchronization are preserved.

## 408-FLOW-1.1 — Auto Bundle → CoverageFit Continuation

- Public runtime advances to `408-BUY-1.3` because `/auto-bundle/` now continues into the existing CoverageFit Home assessment after lead submission.
- The existing lead form now uses the shared prospect-profile and CoverageFit handoff modules with `entry=auto_bundle_form`, `launch_surface=auto_bundle`, and `next=/assessment/`.
- Contact, property, housing context, campaign attribution, consent, and lead-capture status use the same zero-repeat browser handoff contract as the established Home and occupational forms.
- The prior thank-you page remains the safe fallback if the CoverageFit launcher is unavailable; no parallel bundle assessment or recommendation engine was introduced.
- Auto Bundle CTA language now describes a coverage review rather than promising a bundle price.

## 408-RC-SMS-1.9 — Operations Dashboard + Reliability Synchronization

- Public runtime remains `408-BUY-1.2`; RC-SMS-1.9 requires no new public acquisition fields or secrets.
- Synchronizes with CoverageFit v3.20.27 protected SMS operations dashboard, delivery retry queue, webhook health, stale detection, retention cleanup, redacted audit trail, and campaign reporting.
- Secure handoff URLs remain opaque; CoverageFit lifecycle tracking uses a separate server-backed opaque reference after handoff resolution.
- Existing buyer, homeowner, bundle, RUSH, realtor attribution, and manual-takeover contracts remain intact.

## 408-RC-SMS-1.8 — Homeowner, Bundle + Expanded RUSH Synchronization

- Existing realtor partner attribution and `/buyer/` text-first behavior remain unchanged.

## 408-RC-SMS-1.6 — Realtor Partner Attribution

- `/buyer/` accepts `partner_code`, `sms_code`, or `ref_code` and includes `Ref: CODE` in the existing buyer SMS prefill.
- Website-first `partner_id` / `partner_name` attribution remains intact.
- CoverageFit v3.20.24 resolves SMS codes server-side and carries the canonical partner identity through the opaque handoff.
